## Future Plans

JamJam functions as a basic user verification discord bot for JAMHacks. As of now, we plan to maintain this bot by keeping it up to date with Discord's API versions using [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) npm package. In the future we may add more "fun" features or features to further assist the JAMHacks hackathon instead of just verifying users.
